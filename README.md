# British-Airways-Virtual-Data-Science-Programme
This repository contains solutions to the 2 different tasks that must be performed during the data science virtual internship provided by British Airways via Forage.

# Task 1
- applying webscraping in unstructured data taken from the https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways
- analyze customer reviews using sentimental analysis to sort positive and negative reviews
- preparing a powerpoint representation to highlight our insights and analysis

# Task 2
Background Information
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This is possible with the use of data and predictive models. The most important factor with a predictive model is the quality of the data you use to train the machine learning algorithms. For this task, you must manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data so that you can build a high-quality predictive model.

With your predictive model, it is important to interpret the results in order to understand how “predictive” the data really was and whether we can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). Therefore, you should evaluate the model's performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model's power.

- creating a classification model to predict customer buying behaviour
- preparing a powerpoint representation to highlight our insights and analysis

# Summary
British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage
- Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways success
- Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings
- Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour
